				<div class="bio-span">About ROHI</div>
				<p>My name is Rohi Anon Ogula, AKA RAO. I am an apt quirk with lots of love for computers</p>
				<p>Currently, I am 21 years old eager to explore the whole lot of computing world especially data science and web-development</p>
				<p>I study at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, pursuing a degree in Statistics</p>
				<p>County of Residence is Busia (Kenya)</p>
				<p>My area of specialization is kinda ... Actually a better term to describe me is that I am a generalist. Howerver, I love Math more than anything else.</p>
				<p>The best language tool I often use is Python, followed by R. Web tools have been a nightmare for me for a long time. After understanding that models ought to be deployed I had to learn it the hard way.</p>
				<p>I tend to love opportunities and take them no matter the cost. Recently, after finishing up with my Machine Learning Track at coursera, I decided to get deep into the world of web. A fried of mine called Siranjofu Wachiye motivated me to with the words <em>MY FUTURE LIES IN MY WEB BROWSER</em></p>
				<p>This other <em>MY NEXT MOVE/PROJECT IS THE BEST OF ALL</em> gave me a jumpstart</p>
				<p>With all this said and done, here comes the first of it's kind</p>
				<p>Django is soon coming</p>
